# #Instagram clone project

Hi! I'm currently developing a `UIKit-based` Instagram clone using `Swift` and `Firebase`. The primary objective is to recreate the core tabs of the **Instagram app**, ensuring both functionality and a realistic appearance. This project serves as a valuable practice for mobile development, allowing me to gain hands-on experience in creating a complete app with backend integration.
> *Please note that this project is currently under active development, and I'll be regularly pushing new code to the repository. As progress is made, I'll also update the readme file to provide the latest information on the project.*
