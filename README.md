# #Instagram clone project


Hi! I'm currently developing a `UIKit-based` Instagram clone using `Swift` and `Firebase`. The primary objective is to recreate the core tabs of the **Instagram app**, ensuring both functionality and a realistic appearance. This project serves as a valuable practice for mobile development, allowing me to gain hands-on experience in creating a complete app with backend integration.
> *Please note that this project is currently under active development, and I'll be regularly pushing new code to the repository. As progress is made, I'll also update the readme file to provide the latest information on the project.*

## Login ViewController

This login view controller is designed to adapt to the user's system color background, ensuring functionality in both dark and light themes.

Clicking the `Terms of Service` or `Privacy Policy` presents the **SafariServices** view controller with Terms of Service and Privacy Policy respectfully.

The login functionality is integrated with `Firebase`, and if a user attempts to log in with a non-existing account, an error message will be displayed.
